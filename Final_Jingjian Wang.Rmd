## Background
### About Research:

1) **Research question**: What is the association between rent or owned home and general/mental health status in pregnant people during 2016-2021?

2) **PICOT item in research question**:

+ Population = individuals who are pregnant, age between 18-54, with annual household income greater than \$35,000

+ Intervention = rent home

+ Comparison group = those who live in owned home

+ Outcome = general health status (fair or bad vs. excellent or good)

+ Timeframe = 2014-2021

3) **Datasource**: BRFSS 2016-2021 surveys (<https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_data.htm> (Links to an external site.))

4) **Variables**: RENTHOM1, GENHLTH, \_MEN14LD, PREGNANT, \_INCOMG1, \_INCOMG, \_AGE80, \_AGE_G, \_EDUCAG, \_IMPRACE, \_RACE, EMPLOY1

5) **Data clean**: See Data Clean.Rmd. NAs have been dropped to make a complete case analysis

##### `Age` - Continuous or Categorical

###### Box-Tidwell test

```{r}
# Box-Tidwell test, test the assumption of linearity
BRFSS.clean$age_times_log_age<-BRFSS.clean$Age * log(BRFSS.clean$Age)

testlinearity_G<-glm(GHLTH ~ Age + age_times_log_age, data=BRFSS.clean, family="binomial") 
summary(testlinearity_G)
testlinearity_M<-glm(MHLTH ~ Age + age_times_log_age, data=BRFSS.clean, family="binomial") 
summary(testlinearity_M)
```
###### Interpretation

```{r}
# Since the p-value for age_times_log_age <.05, we reject the null hypothesis. The linearity assumption is not met using the Box-Tidwell test and Age cannot be modelling as a linear term. Instead, AgeG will be used.

### Model for General Health

#### Model with only `RENTHOM` and `GENHLTH`
```{r}
modelGH0<-glm(GHLTH ~ RENTHOM, data=BRFSS.clean, family="binomial")
tidy(modelGH0, conf.int=TRUE, exponentiate = TRUE)
```
##### Interpretation

```{r}
# For the unadjusted model, those who rent their houses had 121% higher odds of having bad general health status than those who own their houses (OR = 2.21; 95% CI 1.71-2.86; N = 6995) 
```


#### Model that includes `RENTHOM` + `AgeG` + `EDU` + `EMPLOY` + `Race` as covariates.

```{r}
modelGH1<-glm(GHLTH ~ RENTHOM + AgeG + EDU + EMPLOY + Race, data=BRFSS.clean, family="binomial")
summary(modelGH1)
tidy(modelGH1, conf.int=TRUE, exponentiate = TRUE)
odds.n.ends(modelGH1)
```

##### Interpretation

```{r}
# For the adjusted model, those who rent their houses had 84% higher odds of having bad general health status than those who own their houses (OR = 1.84; 95% CI 1.40-2.42; N = 6995) 

```
##### Plot of Cook's Distance

```{r}
plot(modelGH1, which=4, id.n=4, col="red") 
```

##### Whether or not to exlude observations

```{r}
# Obtain Cook's Distance 
modelGH1.data <- augment(modelGH1) %>% 
  mutate(index = 1:n()) 

# Set the cutoff value to 3 * mean of Cook's D, and then exclude observations with values greater than the cutoff value
cuttoff_GH1 <- mean(modelGH1.data$.cooksd)*3

# Since the outcome variable does not have balanced distribution, this would result in loss in the whole subgroup of those with negative health outcomes
BRFSS.GH1<- modelGH1.data %>%
  filter(.cooksd<cuttoff_GH1)
summary(BRFSS.GH1)

# As we can see from the result, there are 0 observations in 'Bad' group of GHLTH - The Cook's D values are not large and I'll go with the first model.

```

##### Interpretation

```{r}
# For the unadjusted model, those who rent their houses had 70% higher odds of having bad mental health status than those who own their houses (OR = 1.70; 95% CI 1.42-2.02; N = 6995).

```

#### Model that includes `RENTHOM` + `AgeG` + `EDU` + `EMPLOY` + `Race` as covariates.

```



##### Interpretation

```{r}
# For the adjusted model, those who rent their houses had 49% higher odds of having bad mental health status than those who own their houses (OR = 1.49; 95% CI 1.24-1.80; N = 6995).

## Discussion

### Findings


1) Those who rent their houses had 84% higher odds of having bad general health status than those who own their houses (OR = 1.84; 95% CI 1.40-2.42; N = 6995), adjusting for age, education, employment, and race. 
2) Those who rent their houses had 49% higher odds of having bad mental health status than those who own their houses (OR = 1.49; 95% CI 1.24-1.80; N = 6995), adjusting for age, education, employment, and race. 
3) Effect modification was not observed.
4) Race changes the ORs by 10%, which shows that race is a true confounder.


### Limitations


1) The independent variable only shows housing tenure but cannot take detailed context of housing into account.
2) The model is not good at prediction because the distribution of dependent variables is not balanced - more than 90% with "Good" Health status.
3) The variable income was restricted but not controlled in the model since the limited categories from BRFSS survey – there could be residual confounding.



## Conclusion

1) The results suggest that those who rent their houses have higher odds of having bad general and mental health status. 
2) Employment is not an effect modifier. 
3) This understanding can raise people’s awareness about housing problems and provide a new direction for future studies. 
4) Further research is needed to identify mechanisms for the association between housing tenure and health status.
